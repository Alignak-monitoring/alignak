About Alignak
==============

Alignak is an open source monitoring framework written in Python under the terms of the `GNU Affero General Public License`_ .
It's a fork of Shinken



Alignak Project
================

Alignak is now an open source monitoring *framework* but was first created to be a open source monitoring *solution*.
This difference is important for the team, a framework does not have the same use than an all in one solution.
The main idea when developing Alignak is the flexibility which is our definition of framework.
Nevertheless, Alignak was first made differently and we try to keep all the good things that made it a monitoring solution :
   * Easy to install : install is mainly done with pip but some packages are available (deb / rpm) and we are planning to provide nightly build.
   * Easy for new users : once installed, Alignak provide a simple command line interface to install new module and packs.
   * Easy to migrate from Nagios : we want Nagios configuration and plugins to work in Alignak so that it is a "in place" replacement.
     Plugins provide great flexibility and are a big legacy codebase to use. It would be a shame not to use all this community work
   * Multi-platform : python is available in a lot of OS. We try to write generic code to keep this possible.
   * Utf8 compliant : python is here to do that. For now Alignak is compatible with 2.6-2.7 version but python 3.X is even more character encoding friendly.
   * Independent from other monitoring solution : our goal is to provide a modular *tool* that can integrate with others through standard interfaces). Flexibility first.
   * Flexible : in an architecture point view. It is very close to our scalability wish. Cloud computing is make architecture moving a lot, we have to fit to it.
   * Fun to code : python ensure good code readability. Adding code should not be a pain when developing.

This is basically what Alignak is made of. Maybe add the "keep it simple" Linux principle and it's prefect. There is nothing we don't want, we consider every features / ideas.


Features
=========

Alignak has a lot of features, we started to list some of them in the last paragraph. Let's go into details:

  * Role separated daemons : we want a daemon to do one thing but doing it good. There are 6 of them but one is not compulsory.
  * Great flexibility : you didn't got that already? Alignak modules allow it to talk to almost everything you can imagine.

  Those to points involve all the following :

  * Data export to databases :

      * Graphite
      * InfluxDB
      * RRD
      * GLPI
      * CouchDB
      * Livestatus  (MK_Livestatus reimplementation)
      * Socket write for other purpose (Splunk, Logstash, Elastic Search)
      * MySQL (NDO reimplementation)
      * Oracle (NDO reimplementation)

  * Integration with web user interface :

      * WebUI (Alignak own UI)
      * Thruk
      * Adagios
      * Multisite
      * Nagvis
      * PNP4Nagios
      * NConf
      * Centreon (With NDO, not fully working, not recommended)


  * Import config from databases :

      * GLPI
      * Amazon EC2
      * MySQL
      * MongoDB
      * Canonical Landscape


  * Alignak provide sets of configuration, named packs, for a huge number of services :

      * Databases (Mysql, Oracle, MSSQL, memcached, mongodb, influxdb etc.)
      * Routers, Switches (Cisco, Nortel, Procurve etc.)
      * OS (Linux, windows, Aix, HP-UX etc.)
      * Hypervisors (VMWare, Vsphere)
      * Protocols (HTTP, SSH, LDAP, DNS, IMAP, FTP, etc.)
      * Application (Weblogic, Exchange, Active Directory, Tomcat, Asterisk, etc.)
      * Storage (IBM-DS, Safekit, Hacmp, etc.)

  * Smart SNMP polling : The SNMP Booster module is a must have if you have a huge infrastructure of routers and switches.

  * Scalability : no server overloading, you just have to install new daemons on another server and load balancing is done.


  But Alignak is even more :

  * Realm concept : you can monitor independent environments / customer
  * DMZ monitroing : some daemon have passive facilities so that firewall don't block monitoring.
  * Business impact : Alignak can differentiate impact of a critical alert on a toaster versus the web store
  * Efficient correlation between parent-child relationship and business process rules
  * High availability : daemons can have spare ones.
  * Business rules :  For a higher level of monitoring. Alignak can notify you only if 3 out 5 of your server are down
  * Very open-minded team : help is always welcome, there is job for everyone.


Release cycle
==============


Alignak team is trying to setup a new release cycle with an objective of 4 release per year.
Each release is divided into three part :  re-factoring (few weeks), features (one month), freezing (one month).
Roadmap is available in a `specific Github issue`_, feature addition can be discussed there.
Technical point of view about a specific feature are discussed in a separated issue.


Release code names
===================

I (Jean Gab√®s) keep the right to name the code name of each release. That's the only thing I will keep for me in this project as its founder. :)
