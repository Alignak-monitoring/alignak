.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Alignak is a monitoring application made of several daemons which features may be extended thanks to modules. Each daemon type has its own role in the monitoring process.
.SS Arbiter
.sp
The \fBArbiter\fP (see man alignak\-scheduler(8)) daemon role:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Loading the Alignak own configuration (daemons, behavior, ...)
.IP \(bu 2
Loading the monitored system objects configuration (hosts, services, contacts, ...), loaded from Nagios legacy configuration files or from the Alignak backend database
.IP \(bu 2
Dispatching the whole framework configuration to the other daemons
.IP \(bu 2
Managing daemons connections and monitoring the state of the other daemons
.IP \(bu 2
Forwarding failed daemons configuration to spare daemons
.IP \(bu 2
Receiving external commands
.IP \(bu 2
Collecting the monitoring events log
.IP \(bu 2
Reporting Alignak state
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
There can have only one active Arbiter, other arbiters (if they exist in the configuration) are acting as standby spares.
.SS Scheduler
.sp
The \fBScheduler\fP (see man alignak\-scheduler(8)) daemon role:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
scheduling the checks to launch
.IP \(bu 2
determines action to execute (notifications, acknowledges, ...)
.IP \(bu 2
dispatches the checks and actions to execute to the pollers and reactionners
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
There can have many schedulers for load\-balancing; each scheduler is managing its own hosts list.
.SS Poller
.sp
The \fBPoller\fP (see man alignak\-poller(8)) runs the active checks required by the \fBScheduler\fP\&.
.sp
There can have many pollers for load\-balancing.
.SS Receiver
.sp
The \fBReceiver\fP (see man alignak\-receiver(8)) daemon receives the passive checks and external commands.
.sp
There can have many receivers for load\-balancing.
.SS Broker
.sp
The \fBBroker\fP (see man alignak\-broker(8)) daemon gets all the broks from the other daemons. It propagates the events to its specialized modules (eg. Alignak backend database storage, ...)
.sp
There can have many brokers for load\-balancing.
.SS Reactionner
.sp
The \fBReactionner\fP (see man alignak\-reactionner(8)) daemon runs the event handlers and sends the notifications to the users.
.sp
There can have many reactionners for load\-balancing.
