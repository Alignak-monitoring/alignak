# This file is copied to the home directory of the *alignak* user, this to be found easily
# by any application which needs to know more about the Alignak installation.

# It is also copied to the *alignak/etc* directory and renamed as *default*, this to be used as
# /etc/default/alignak for the init scripts.

# Main alignak variables:
# - BIN is where the launch scripts are located
# - ETC is where we store the configuration files
# - RUN is the daemons working directory and where pid files are stored
# - LOG is where we put log files
# - INIT is where the default init scripts are stored
# - LIBEXEC is where the plugins files are installed
#
# Those variables are updated during the Alignak installation process (eg. python setup.py install)
# to indicate where the installer copied the files.

# For each Alignak daemon, we define:
# - the location of its configuration file
# - its launching script
# - the location of its debug log file (if any is used)
# - the location of its pid file
#
# For the arbiter, we also define the name of the 2 main configuration files.
# There may be 2 configuration files because tools like Centreon generate those...
