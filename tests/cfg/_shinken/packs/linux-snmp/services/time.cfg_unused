    _DETAILLEDESC         Compare system time with time where shinken operate. Both must be synchronized with a ntp source.
    _IMPACT               Average: Log, database and all records on system with a wrong time. Timeperiod drift and false alerts at wrong time slots.
    _FIXACTIONS           Synchronized systems with ntp. Set time to be slewed by ntpdate rather than stepped.
