# This version of the file contains variable that are suitable to run a single node Alignak
# with all its daemon using the default configuration existing in the repository.
#

# Main alignak variables:
# - BIN is where the launch scripts are located
#   (Debian sets to /usr/bin)
# - ETC is where we store the configuration files
#   (Debian sets to /etc/alignak)
# - VAR is where the libraries and plugins files are installed
#   (Debian sets to /var/lib/alignak)
# - RUN is the daemons working directory and where pid files are stored
#   (Debian sets to /var/run/alignak)
# - LOG is where we put log files
#   (Debian sets to /var/log/alignak)

# For each Alignak daemon, this file contains a section with the daemon name. The section
# identifier is the corresponding daemon name. This daemon name is built with the daemon
# type (eg. arbiter, poller,...) and the daemon name separated with a dash.
#Â This rule ensure that alignak will be able to find all the daemons configuration in this
# whatever the number of daemons existing in the configuration
#
# Each section defines:
# - the location of the daemon configuration file
# - the daemon launching script
# - the location of the daemon pid file
# - the location of the daemon debug log file (if any is to be used)
