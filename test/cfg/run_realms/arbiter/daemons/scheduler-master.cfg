# - Requesting actions from a reactionner
# - Buffering and forwarding results its associated broker

    ## Realm
    #realm                   All

    ## Modules
    # Default: None
    # Interesting modules that can be used:
    # - backend_scheduler   = store the live state in the Alignak backend (retention)
    #modules                 backend_scheduler

    ## Optional parameters:
    timeout                 3   ; Ping timeout
    data_timeout            120 ; Data send timeout
    max_check_attempts      3   ; If ping fails N or more, then the node is dead
    check_interval          60  ; Ping node every N seconds

    # In a HA architecture this daemon can be a spare
    spare                   0   ; 1 = is a spare, 0 = is not a spare

    # Enable https or not
    use_ssl	                0
    # enable certificate/hostname check, will avoid man in the middle attacks
    hard_ssl_name_check     0

    ## Advanced Features:
    # Skip initial broks creation. Boot fast, but some broker modules won't
    # work with it! (like livestatus for example)
    skip_initial_broks      0

    # Some schedulers can manage more hosts than others
    weight                  1

    # In NATted environments, you declare each satellite ip[:port] as seen by
    # *this* scheduler (if port not set, the port declared by satellite itself
    # is used)
    #satellitemap    poller-1=1.2.3.4:7771, reactionner-1=1.2.3.5:7769, ...
