#===============================================================================
# The receiver manages passive information. It's just a "buffer" which will
# load passive modules (like NSCA) and be read by the arbiter to dispatch data.

    # Default: None
    # Interesting modules that can be used:
    # - nsca                = NSCA protocol server for collecting passive checks
    # - external-commands   = read a nagios commands file to notify external commands
    # - web-services        = expose Web services to get Alignak daemons state and
    #                         notify external commands

    data_timeout            120 ; Data send timeout
    max_check_attempts      3   ; If ping fails N or more, then the node is dead
    check_interval          60  ; Ping node every N seconds

                                ; command.
