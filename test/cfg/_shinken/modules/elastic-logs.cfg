    # Remove indices older than the specified value
    # Value is specified as :

    # Services filtering
    # Filter is declared as a comma separated list of items:
    # An item can be a regexp which is matched against service description (hostname/service)
    #  ^test*, matches all hosts which name starts with test
    #  /test*, matches all services which name starts with test
    #
    # An item containing : is a specific filter (only bi is supported currently)
    #  bi:>x, bi:>=x, bi:<x, bi:<=x, bi:=x to match business impact

    # default is to consider only the services which business impact is > 4
    # 3 is the default value for business impact if property is not explicitely declared
    # Default is only bi>4 (most important services)
    #services_filter bi:>4
