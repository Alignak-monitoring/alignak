    # MongoDB connection string
    # EXAMPLE
    # To describe a connection to a replica set named test, with the following mongod hosts:
    #   db1.example.net on port 27017 with sysop credentials and
    #   db2.example.net on port 2500.
    # You would use a connection string that resembles the following:
    #   uri     mongodb://sysop:password@db1.example.net,db2.example.net:2500/?replicaSet=test
    #
    # Default is a non replicated localhost server
    #uri                  mongodb://192.168.0.50
    uri                  mongodb://localhost

    # Database name where to store the retention collections
    # Default is shinken
    #database             shinken

    # Load retention data from a previous retention using flat file
    # Useful to migrate from flat file retention to MongoDB retention ...
    #path            /var/lib/shinken/retention.dat

    # Default collections names
    # -----------------------------
    # Hosts and services objects
    # Comments and downtimes
    # -----------------------------
    # Comments and downtimes are stored inside hosts/services objects AND in comments/downtimes
    # to make them persist when they are deleted ...
    #hosts_collection_name       retention_hosts
    #services_collection_name    retention_services
    #comments_collection_name    retention_comments
    #downtimess_collection_name  retention_downtimes
