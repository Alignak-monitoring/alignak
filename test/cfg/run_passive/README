# This configuration is built as such:
# - the 6 standard alignak daemons
# - a localhost host that is checked with _internal host check and that has no services
# - this host is in the only existing realm (All)
# - this host has 5 services that each run the script ./dummy_command.sh
# - services are: ok, warning, critical, unknown and timeout, thus to check that poller workers
# run correctly the checks action and that the reactionner daemon run correctly its actions
# - the 4 first services are run normally, the last one raises a timeout alert
# - one more service that uses the internal _echo command that set the same state as the current
# one, thus the default initial state
