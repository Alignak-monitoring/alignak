# For each Alignak daemon, this file contains a section with the daemon name. The section
# identifier is the corresponding daemon name prefixed with the keyword daemon and a dot.
# This daemon name is usually built with the daemon type (eg. arbiter, poller,...) and the
# daemon name separated with a dash.
#
# The previous rules ensure that Alignak will be able to find all the daemons configuration
# in this file whatever the number of daemons is existing in the configuration
#
# To be easily used as a configuration variable of this file, the daemon name is repeated
# inside the section in a NAME variable.
#
# Each section inherits from the [DEFAULT] section and only defines the specific values
# inherent to the declared daemon.

; Advanced Features:
; If set, the scheduler will skip initial broks creation. It will be a little faster to start-up

; If set to 0 the min_workers and max_workers values will be configured according to the

; Passive mode
; In active mode (default behavior), connections between scheduler and poller are
