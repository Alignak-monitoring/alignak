    This is used to make a Singleton-like pattern with a python object that inherits from the Borg.

    The Singleton design pattern (DP) has a catchy name, but the wrong focus -- on identity
    rather than on state. The Borg design pattern has all instances share state instead,
    and Python makes it, literally, a snap.
