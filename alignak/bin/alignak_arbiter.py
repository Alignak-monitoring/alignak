"""
This is the class of the Arbiter. Its role is to read configuration,
cut it, and send it to other elements like schedulers, reactionners
or pollers. It is also responsible for the high availability feature.
For example, if a scheduler dies, it sends the late scheduler's conf
to another scheduler available.
It also reads orders form users (nagios.cmd) and sends them to schedulers.
